# File formats and compatibility

**English** · [简体中文](file-format-support.zh-CN.md) · [Documentation](README.md)

Start with [topics](topics.md) to find a use for Glim. Use this page to check what a specific file can show. Entries are grouped by task, retaining format names for lookup. Coverage applies to Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

Previews focus on viewing; ordinary UTF-8 source can be edited and saved automatically. Basic previews may show only structure, coordinates or metadata. Support means the behavior listed in each row; specialist layout, editing and execution have separate limits.

## Office documents

| Files | Actions and limits |
| --- | --- |
| PDF | Embedded PDFKit preview with pages, zoom, text selection and password entry |
| DOC/DOCX/RTF | Single adaptive read-only preview with zoom; automatic Quick Look fallback on failure. Complex layout, drawings, embedded objects and headers/footers may differ |
| PPT/PPTX | Embedded Quick Look read-only preview; availability and layout depend on the system provider |
| XLSX / XLSM / XLS | XLSX/XLSM offer one paged layout preview with styles, merges and cached values. XLS and unsupported structures use Quick Look. No formula recalculation; presentation pages omit charts/drawings and shared-string rich-text formatting |
| KEY/Pages/Numbers | Quick Look read-only preview, including directory packages; no editing or presentation animations |
| ODT/ODS/ODP | Container listing and selected document text extraction |

## Reading, notes and mind maps

| Files | Actions and limits |
| --- | --- |
| Markdown | Native reading layout, tables, task lists, footnotes, alerts, frontmatter, diagrams, formulas, relative images and local links; source editing |
| XMind | Modern JSON and legacy XML containers; sheets, attached/floating topic trees, folding, zoom and topic details. Plain notes, labels, HTTP(S) links and relationship endpoints; read-only |
| AsciiDoc/Org/RST | Basic headings, lists and code-block reading projection with editable original text; not complete dialect rendering |
| D2/Pikchr/`*.vega.json` | Offline static diagrams; source editing. External imports, datasets and images disabled |
| EPUB / FB2 / FB2 ZIP / CBZ | Dedicated read-only book reader: spine/TOC navigation, chapters or comic pages, inline illustrations, typography/paper controls, bookmarks and saved position. Publisher CSS and fixed-layout EPUB are not reproduced |
| OPML | Read-only outline with expand/fold and explicit open/copy link actions; no automatic feed requests |

## Images, graphics and fonts

| Files | Actions and limits |
| --- | --- |
| PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF/BMP/TIFF/ICO/SVG/ICNS/EXR/HDR/QOI | Image previews; GIF animation, multipage TIFF, SDR conversion for EXR/HDR. ICNS needs a PNG representation; SVG external file resources are not loaded |
| TTF/OTF/TTC/OTC/DFONT | CoreText font/collection inspection, glyphs and custom samples; fonts are not installed |
| BDF | A bounded bitmap glyph preview; no font installation |
| draw.io | Basic shapes, text, connectors and page previews; custom shapes, embedded images, rich text and exact routing may be simplified or omitted |

## Audio, video and subtitles

| Files | Actions and limits |
| --- | --- |
| MP3/MP4/MKV/M4A/M4V/MOV/AAC/WAV/AIF/AIFF/CAF/FLAC | Embedded AVKit playback and ordered/shuffled folder playlists. H.264/AAC-LC MKV is losslessly remuxed to a temporary MP4, including Matroska mislabeled `.mp4`. Other MKV codecs and embedded subtitles are unsupported; other media decoding depends on system codecs |
| SRT/VTT | Read subtitles by timestamp; edit source. Not synchronized with media playback |

## Tables, structured data and databases

| Files | Actions and limits |
| --- | --- |
| JSON/JSONC/JSON5, NDJSON/JSONL, GeoJSON, notebooks | Source and an on-demand read-only tree. JSONC accepts comments/trailing commas; NDJSON becomes a line-record array. GeoJSON is not a map and notebooks are not executed |
| CSV/TSV | Virtualized read-only table and editable source; quoted/multiline fields, BOM and uneven rows supported |
| DB/DB3/SQLite/SQLite3 and recognized SQLite headers | Read-only temporary snapshot; tables/views, schema, SQL definitions and paged records. Associated WAL/SHM/journal files resolve to the main database when available |
| YAML / TOML / XML | Basic source editing; YAML and XML support structured interactive graphs, while TOML is outside that graph scope |

## Source, configuration and binary files

| Files | Actions and limits |
| --- | --- |
| Rust, C/C++, Go, Swift, Java, C#, Kotlin, Zig, Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, Scala, Elixir, shell | Source highlighting, folding, search, Minimap and basic UTF-8 editing |
| JS/TS/JSX/TSX, HTML, CSS, Astro, Svelte, ERB/EJS, Jinja/Jinja2/Nunjucks/Twig | Source highlighting; some templates use lightweight coloring rather than full grammars |
| Vue, XML/plist, SCSS/LESS, Cython, CUDA/Metal, GLSL/OSL | Reuse related language highlighting; no dedicated semantic validation |
| Dockerfile/Containerfile, Makefile/CMake, Nix, INI, `.env`, ignore files and related configuration | Highlighted or lightly colored text; editing, not execution |
| HTML/HTM | WebKit browser preview with CSS/JavaScript and editable source; relative local assets within the enclosing Git project (otherwise the document directory) load in streamed chunks |
| TXT, logs and other UTF-8 text | Basic editing; large or very long-line documents use editable UTF-8 pages |
| Binary dotfiles such as `.DS_Store` | Bounded hexadecimal/ASCII preview; no semantic decoding or editing |
| MATLAB/Stan/HTTP/HCL/Dhall/KDL | Basic lexical coloring and editing; scripts, requests and configurations are not executed |

## Specialist files and archives

| Files | Actions and limits |
| --- | --- |
| safetensors | Tensor names, shapes, dtypes, parameter counts and metadata from the header; weights are not loaded or executed |
| OBJ/STL | Static mesh projection; OBJ faces and ASCII/binary STL. No interactive rotation, materials or textures |
| GPX/KML | Offline coordinate table and XML source; no map tiles or external resources |
| ZIP | Browse entries and sizes; AppleDouble metadata hidden by default. Cancellable background extraction to a separate new directory without overwriting existing directories; open as a new workspace on completion |
| TAR | Entry names and sizes, with unsafe paths identified; no extraction |
| GZ/BZ2/XZ | On-demand decompression into complete source pages with a bounded rolling cache |
| NPY | v1/v2/v3 headers and a bounded preview of basic little-endian f8/f4/i8/i4/u1 values; other types retain metadata, no pickle execution |

A `.key` file can also be a text cryptographic key: only ZIP containers and document packages use the Keynote reader; default associations can affect both uses. XMind uses a consistent reading layout without original manual positions, images, attachments, boundaries or summaries. Links do not open automatically.

## Markdown diagrams and formulas

| Engine | Fences and supported syntax |
| --- | --- |
| Mermaid | `mermaid`/`mmd`; flowcharts, subgraphs, sequence/class/state/ER diagrams, Gantt, pie, mind maps, Journey, Radar, Treemap and engine-supported types. `zenuml` also supported |
| Graphviz | `dot`/`graphviz` |
| PlantUML | `plantuml`/`puml`/`uml`; `@startuml` wrappers optional. Bundled C4/themes/emoji/OpenIconic; basic Salt and Chen ER adapters; `@startdot` routes to Graphviz |
| flowchart.js | `flow`/`flowchart`/`flowchart.js`; explicit Mermaid `flowchart`/`graph` declarations route to Mermaid |
| WaveDrom | `wavedrom`/`wavejson`; JSON/JSON5 input, not JavaScript |
| LaTeX | `$…$`/`$$…$$`, separate `$$` block lines, standalone `\[ … \]`, and `math`/`latex`/`tex`/`katex` fences |
| GitHub Alerts | Blockquotes beginning `[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!WARNING]` or `[!CAUTION]` |

Explicit Mermaid, PlantUML and Graphviz declarations can identify unlabelled fences. Diagrams become static images; source and saved contents stay unchanged. Failed blocks show their error and source. Engines are bundled for offline use and render through system WebKit on macOS.

Salt and Chen ER are partial adapters, not complete PlantUML dialects. Unsupported preprocessing/includes, rich content, external resources and incompatible `foreignObject` output fail visibly. Salt supports common wireframe controls; Chen supports common entities, attributes, relationships, cardinality and participation, not the full EER dialect. External images and unbundled includes are not loaded.

## Shared reader boundaries

Application thresholds are managed in [assets/reader-limits.json](../assets/reader-limits.json). The [generated inventory](reader-limits.md) lists every configured value, unit and effect. Rust, native Swift and diagram JavaScript consume that one policy. Fixed input caps, truncation, paging thresholds, preview dimensions and working-memory/time budgets remain separate concepts; total-file caps are replaced by streaming, paging or complete source fallback.

Preview limits do not truncate source files. Non-UTF-8 ordinary text is not currently decoded. Office previews do not edit, run macros or recalculate formulas.

SQLite copies the main database, WAL and rollback journal into a private snapshot and checks source stability. It does not checkpoint the original. Encrypted databases and arbitrary write SQL are unsupported.

MKV supports H.264/AAC-LC remuxing, including AVC configuration and Annex-B frames. Compressed/encrypted tracks, codec delay and duplicate-timestamp lacing remain unsupported. Original files and display names are preserved; temporary media is released with the native reader. Folder playlists enumerate direct children and skip unsupported items; restored playback is paused.

## Reader details

Markdown remote images load over HTTP(S) in the background, using the shared response and timeout budgets. Failed downloads or decoding show a visible placeholder. Common picture light/dark candidates follow the theme; unknown media conditions retain the img fallback. SVG does not run scripts or read external resources. Standard external SVG document type declarations are discarded; internal DTD subsets remain unsupported. Relative local images retain existing path resolution. System curl is required for this Markdown image path. HTML previews use WebKit networking and layout instead.

Mach-O (including universal), ELF and PE files are recognized by their headers and inspected read-only. The preview shows architecture, word size, byte order, entry point, segments/sections, available dependency names and a hexadecimal excerpt. Metadata working budgets use the shared policy. Programs are never executed or decompiled; malformed inputs report errors; metadata working-budget exhaustion retains complete hex pages, and dependencies are shown only where the corresponding headers can be parsed.

Ebook limits are listed in the shared policy inventory. Text and image resources are loaded locally; remote images and active content are not fetched or executed. DRM EPUB, MOBI/AZW, PDF book layout, publisher stylesheet fidelity and fixed-layout EPUB are outside this reader. Space/Page Down and Shift-Space/Page Up turn viewport pages; Left/Right switch chapters. Reading preferences and bookmarks are stored separately from book files.

XLSX layout preview is paginated to avoid provider truncation; the complete cell index is retained internally, without a separate cell-data mode. GPX/KML coordinates have page controls; diagrams load automatically in batches for the visible area. Complex books, XMind, mesh/font projections and tensor headers retain complete source fallbacks. Native images may use a scaled raster; actual-size zoom does not guarantee original-resolution decoding. SQLite full-value windows do not bound the engine’s internal expression allocations. ZIP directory indexing and native Quick Look/WebKit behavior remain library/platform constraints.

Presentation files (PPT, PPTX, Keynote) offer **Play Slideshow** in the floating toolbar. This expands the embedded Quick Look preview into a fullscreen presentation in its current window; use the system document controls to navigate and Escape to leave. Slide navigation, transitions, animations and embedded media depend on the installed system provider. Google Slides cloud links and HTML slide frameworks are not imported by this entry.

PDF also offers **Play Slideshow**, using PDFKit single-page full-screen display from the current page. Arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Space/Shift-Space and Home/End navigate; Escape or the floating Exit Slideshow button returns to the last displayed page. Already-unlocked documents remain unlocked.

Raster image previews offer **Extract Text** in the floating toolbar. Apple Vision recognizes the current image page locally; a separate result window supports selecting/copying text and Copy All. Recognition uses the current decoded preview: use Actual size first for small text in large images. OCR is approximate, produces plain text, and is not available in SVG previews.

Office/iWork and PDF toolbars offer **Copy Preview Text** and **Recognize Image Text**. Word and PDF prefer selected text, then loaded reading/current-page text. Other native previews copy the text exposed by the current system provider, including cell values; output is plain text and table formatting is provider-dependent. PDF OCR recognizes the current page. OOXML/iWork embedded images are recognized one supported raster at a time, with Next image and Copy All in the result window. Legacy binary Office embedded images and vector resources are not decoded by this extraction path. Word offers Reading mode / Original layout switching. Excel uses a single paged preview without a separate cell-data mode.

## Maintenance

`cargo run -p glim-services --example audit_formats --locked -- /path/to/project` samples an explicit format allowlist and prints counts, not private paths or file contents. It is not an exhaustive support audit or a UI test.
