# Shared reader policy

All application reader boundaries take their numeric values from [assets/reader-limits.json](../assets/reader-limits.json). Edit a category’s `value`, preserving its `type`, `unit` and `effect`, then rebuild and install. Null values retire total-size/count gates. Finite values govern a specific feature, page or resource budget; see the behavior description.

Build scripts use `scripts/generate-reader-limits.py` to generate Rust constants, Swift ReaderLimits and embedded JSON in Cargo OUT_DIR. The diagram WebView receives that same JSON. Rendering does not read the policy from disk. Format validity, codec support and UI geometry remain responsibilities of their implementations.

This page is generated from the same policy. After editing it, run `python3 scripts/generate-reader-limits.py --docs` to update both language inventories. Ordinary builds write generated files only to OUT_DIR.

## text

| `io.cache_bytes` | 64 MiB | bytes | budget | Working cache/projection allowance for decoded text, executable metadata and vector/font projection buffers. Old text ranges regenerate; oversized representations retain complete source/byte pages. |
| `io.record_bytes` | 64 MiB | bytes | budget | One active XML/structured metadata record or value, independent of total file size; oversized records retain complete Source/header pages or native preview access. |

## svg

| Key | Value | Unit | Effect | Behavior |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `svg.event_bytes` | 64 MiB | bytes | budget | One active XML markup/text record in the sanitizer, not a document total gate; native File bytes retains the complete source when preparation exceeds this budget. |

## resources

| Key | Value | Unit | Effect | Behavior |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| `resources.cache_bytes` | 256 MiB | bytes | budget | Process-wide budget for tracked reclaimable reader caches; evict background then least recently used unpinned values. Live state and active work are accounted separately and never discarded as cache. Framework allocations are outside this ledger. |
| `resources.working_bytes` | 512 MiB | bytes | budget | Shared target for reader working buffers. Producers using atomic reservations adapt their output window to remaining capacity before allocation; reservations follow retained results. Legacy tracked allocations count against availability but are not yet constrained by admission. Protected editing state and opaque framework allocations are separate. |

## remote
